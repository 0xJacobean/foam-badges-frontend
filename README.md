FOAM FRONTEND BADGES

This is an ongoing project tied to a grant received from FOAM to build out their badge program. FOAM is a decentralized geolocation service: https://foam.space/. This frontend is meant to display the badges a user has collected by contributing to the FOAM platform or could collect as a result of participation.
